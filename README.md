# THIS IS NOW UNSUPPORTED THE UPSTREAM RELEASE NOW DEALS WITH MOST OF THE THINGS THIS DOES

#A modified version of phusion/passenger-customizable

This is a modified version of https://github.com/phusion/passenger-docker

There's nothing wrong with the phusion image (it's really good!). This contains some changes that
I personally find useful.

* Replace syslog-ng with rsyslog with tcp logging enabled
* Remove the syslog-forwarder to docker logs, I don't use docker logs if I can help it
* Use my own build of nodejs
* Add an exim service (it isn't installed you can install it with `apt-get -y install exim4-daemon-light`
* Sends nginx logs to syslog
* Runs logrotate in the build so that on first run of logrotate the logs are rotated, useful for containers using volumes that are restarted
* Generates ssh host keys even if ssh isn't running 
* Tweaks the nginx gzip and ssl configuration
* Exposes the nginx status stub on 0.0.0.0:/nginx_status
* Install security updates when built
* Configures Nginx to handle SSL using the Intermediate settings from https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/
* Includes a small python script to forward logs to syslog
* Uses auto for the number of nginx workers

## SSL HSTS

It's advisable if you run a HTTPS only site to add the HSTS header i.e.
```
# HSTS (ngx_http_headers_module is required) (15768000 seconds = 6 months)
add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=15768000;
```
[HSTS on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)

## Versioning

Releases are tagged with a version according to http://semver.org/
In the changelog I'll note which version of passenger-docker is the base

## pylogger

There is a small script in /usr/local/bin called pylogger which is a replacement for the standard logger tool
Logger has a problem where if the messages are long they're either truncated or split across multiple messages
pylogger logs regardless of the length of the message, see image/nginx.run for a usage example
